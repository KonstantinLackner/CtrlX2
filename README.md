<h1>CrtlX</h1>
<p>This is a very simple word editing game created as a final assignment for the lecture DIKULT 203 21H / Electronic Literature 2021 (https://www.uib.no/en/course/DIKULT203).</p>
<p>The game tells a modular short story that can be edited by the player while reading it. Each level presents a new sentence of the story, the available operations to change the sentences are:</p>
<ol>
<li>cutting words from sentences</li>
<li>changing word positions in sentences</li>
<li>changing word endings</li>
</ol>

<p>Every possible linguistically sensible modulation of a sentence leads to a new outcome.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>One of the sentences in the game reads:</p> 
</p><em>"You cross the burning bridge"</em></p> 
<p>Leaving this sentence unchanged will kill the player. The sentence can, however, be modified into:</p> 
<p><em>"You cross the bridge"</em></p> 
<p>by deleting the "burning" which results in the player crossing the bridge. Another possibility would be to change the sentence to:</p>
<p><em>"You burn the bridge"</em></p> 
<p>resulting in a Troll beating the player
for destroying their home.</p>
